# Process of setting up the feature flag

Feature flags are easier to manage than experiments. Instead of tracking their stats constantly, just determine whether they are needed and when to switch them on or off.

1. Create feature flag
2. Disable it
3. Integrate it into your code (see how to implement feature flags to your code)
4. Enable it to check it when needed

It's done. Your feature flag is working.
